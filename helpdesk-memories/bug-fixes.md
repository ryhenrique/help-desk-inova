# Bug Fixes and Optimizations

## Issues Fixed
1. **Image Path Problem**: All images now use `/helpdesk-uploads/` instead of `/lovable-uploads/`
2. **ID References**: Updated all IDs to use `helpdesk-` prefix instead of `lovable-`
3. **Navigation Links**: Fixed all internal navigation to point to correct helpdesk IDs
4. **Code Display Bug**: Removed any code rendering issues in preview

## Current Status
